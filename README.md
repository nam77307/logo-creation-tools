## FAQ

**Can I use free logo maker designs for commercial purposes without legal issues?**

Most free logo makers like LOGO.com, Namecheap, and Hatchful grant full commercial usage rights for generated designs without additional licensing fees. However, always review specific platform terms confirming trademark rights, resale permissions, and attribution requirements. Some platforms prohibit using logos for competing logo services or reselling design files themselves. Trademark registration remains your responsibility—platforms don't guarantee uniqueness across all global trademarks. Consider hiring trademark attorney for comprehensive protection if building substantial brand value.

**How do AI logo generators compare to hiring professional designers for brand identity?**

AI logo makers excel for speed, affordability, and immediate results costing $0-$80 versus $500-$5,000 for professional designers. They work best for startups, small businesses, and projects requiring rapid turnaround without extensive custom illustration. Professional designers provide strategic brand consultation, completely unique concepts avoiding template limitations, and iterative refinement matching complex requirements. Choose AI tools for straightforward branding needs with tight budgets and timelines. Invest in designers for differentiated brands requiring memorable distinction in competitive markets or when visual identity demands sophisticated storytelling beyond icon-plus-text arrangements.

**What file formats should I download to ensure my logo works everywhere?**

Download vector formats (SVG, EPS, or AI files) enabling infinite scaling without quality loss crucial for large format printing like billboards, vehicle wraps, and building signage. PNG files with transparent backgrounds work for digital applications including websites, social media, and email signatures. High-resolution JPEG or PNG files (300 DPI minimum) serve printed materials like business cards, brochures, and packaging. Most platforms like Looka, LogoGarden, and Wix provide multiple formats in single package. If platform offers only one format, prioritize vector files then convert to raster formats using free tools like Inkscape when needed.
